1. Download the given .py and .csv files
2. Observe the rows to find any peculiarity or outliers in values. While one can use sophisticated algorithms for the same, try sorting the table on sheets to identify these values. 
3. Nonetheless, running the test.py script returns a value of type FLAG{...}
4. Not considering the returned value as final, double encrypt the output (BASE64) and then hash the consequent output with the value 111. That is the final answer.
