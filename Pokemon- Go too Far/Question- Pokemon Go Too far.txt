A mysterious user going by the name
FlagFetcherAsh has been active on a few popular Pokémon discussion boards
lately. In between casual comments about 3D prints and electric-types, they've
hinted at something... strange.
One post mentioned a snapshot left by someone, supposedly uploaded
somewhere in Ash’s “journey logs.” Sources suggest it might contain more than
just pixels, and that the truth is embedded deeper than what the eye can see.
Can you follow the trail through his public profiles, locate the file, and uncover
the hidden coordinates?
