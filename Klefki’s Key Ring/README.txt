# README – Field Notes on the “Key Ring Expedition”  

> An informal travel log chronicling Professor Gearfinch’s month-long study of metallic Pokémon, with a special focus on Klefki, the Key Ring Pokémon.

## 1. Prologue  
Kalos Route 15 greeted us with its usual autumn chill, yet every locker in the ranger outpost rattled as three wild **Klefki** jingled past, flaunting their tiny copper tokens.   
Their chimes, somewhere between a silver wind-bell and a vintage skeleton key, immediately announced the start of our survey.

## 2. Day-to-Day Observations  

### 2.1 Morning Rounds  
At sunrise the local **Klefki** flock performs a curious ritual: each floats to the highest wrought-iron fencepost, unlocks an imaginary latch, then re-locks it with an audible *click*.  
We mapped 27 such posts and confirmed that the route’s gatekeeper swears the locks never jam after these dawn visits. 

### 2.2 Noon Encounters  
Trainers often overlook how territorial **Klefki** become when another Steel-type tries to claim their trove.  
One brave Mawile attempted to steal a nickel-plated house key; within seconds, six **Klefki** formed a whirling ring, producing ultrasonic trills that registered 48 kHz on our recorder.  
The Mawile retreated, clutching its jaws in obvious discomfort.

### 2.3 Sunset Routines  
As light fades, an individual **Klefki** selects a single key from its ring and taps it three times on a stone surface—almost like a bedtime mantra.  
Noctowl behaviorists propose this may be an acoustic beacon so scattered flock-mates can reconvene before nightfall.  
Our spectrograms show the taps resonate strongest at 3.6 kHz, perfectly cutting through ambient Kricketune chirps. 

## 3. Metallurgical Curiosities  
Electron-microscopy revealed microscopic runic grooves along each key blank, suggesting that **Klefki** somehow etches trophies with a Fairy energy–powered acid.  
When we exposed the shavings to a low-temperature plasma torch, the filings emitted a pastel-pink glow—a spectral signature consistent with other Fairy-type residues.

## 4. Interaction Protocols for Trainers  
1. Always present a duplicate key; never attempt to reclaim an original.  
2. Jingle gently—rapid shaking is perceived as aggression.  
3. If you must disengage a **Klefki**, offer a glittering substitute like a Bottle Cap; 90% accept the trade without protest. 

## 5. Epilogue  
Long after the expedition, the outpost’s chief mechanic reported that every lock we catalogued turned smoother, as if subtly re-calibrated.  
Whether coincidence or a modest gift from our **Klefki** friends remains an open mystery, but one thing is clear: where keys sing, doors listen.
