Thematic Title & Story

Team Rocket's Crypto Facility: Operation Digital Infiltration

Team Rocket has established a sophisticated digital fortress to protect their master plan for Pokémon world domination! Their cyber-security division has deployed a multi-layered encryption system based on Pokémon type effectiveness, thinking no Trainer could possibly crack their "unbreakable" code.

Professor Oak's cyber-intelligence unit has discovered Team Rocket's secret facility online, but it's heavily protected by digital barriers. Your mission: infiltrate their crypto facility, exploit their security vulnerabilities, and decrypt their classified master plan to stop their evil scheme!
